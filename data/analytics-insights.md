## Key Patterns

### 1. CTR is King (not impressions)
- **"Buddy..." Dorito quote:** 34.6% CTR — only 211 impressions but 282 views (YouTube kept pushing it because people clicked)
- **TWO HANDSOME GUYS:** 22.7% CTR — low impressions (88) but decent views (43)
- **Beth Oven:** 21.8% CTR — humor in title drives clicks
- **bye bye Matriarch:** 40% CTR — tiny sample but shows curiosity titles work

### 2. Short = Better
- 0:14 and 0:17 clips in top 5
- 0:06 clips too short (GINGY AYO: 7 views, do a flip: 5 views)
- Sweet spot: **14-31 seconds**
- 1:01 clips CAN work if content is compelling (Beth Oven: 179 views)

### 3. Title Style Winners
- **Funny quotes** ("Buddy we have a flying black Dorito...") — highest CTR by far
- **Curiosity/shock** ("racist", "Duplication Glitch") — high CTR
- **Humor/wordplay** ("Beth Oven") — solid performer
- **Name drops** ("nadia tilt", "TFUE") — helps discoverability

### 4. Title Style Losers
- **ALL CAPS YELLING** without substance: YAAAAAAAS (13 views, 0% CTR), PEANUT FLYS AWAY (9 views)
- **Generic game descriptions**: 300 to 100 (9 views), macro sound (15 views)
- **Vague one-word**: leak (2 views), dronecell (2 views)

### 5. Game Tag Helps
- Videos with `| TheBurntPeanut` or `| ARC Raiders` get more impressions
- YouTube likely categorizes them better for recommendation

### 6. The Impression Machine
- "Duplication Glitch" got 2,230 impressions — YouTube pushed it hard
- "peanuts marathon thoughts" got 449 impressions but only 6.2% CTR — YouTube tried, audience didn't click
- **Low CTR kills reach** — YouTube stops pushing after initial test

## Competitive Strategy for Claw's Channel

### Title Optimization
1. Use funny/memorable quotes from the clip when possible
2. Add curiosity hooks ("wait for it", descriptive humor)
3. Include `| {game}` for categorization
4. Keep titles conversational, not ALL CAPS SCREAMING
5. Ideal: quote + context ("Buddy we have a flying black Dorito..." style)

### Clip Selection
1. Prioritize clips 14-31 seconds (sweet spot)
2. Deprioritize clips under 10s or over 50s unless exceptional
3. High view count on Twitch correlates but isn't everything — CTR-worthy titles matter more
4. Look for clips with funny/quotable moments

### What to Build
1. **Title optimizer using local LLM** — feed clip title + context, generate CTR-optimized title
2. **Duration filter** — bias toward 14-31s clips in scoring
3. **A/B test aggressively** — the title_templates system already supports this
